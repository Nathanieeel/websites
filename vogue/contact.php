      <h3>11 NEU Virtual Learning System (NEUVLE) and other Data Processing Systems of the University</h3> 

      <p>The school-student relationship is contractual in nature and the contract between the school and the student is imbued with public interest. The NPC refers to this contract between the school and the student as the “educational framework,” which encompasses all activities and operations the school may perform in line with the students’s education. Any processing of personal information to fulfill the obligations of parties within the educational framework is permissible.</p>

    <h3>7. Procedure for Reporting Security Incident</h3>
    <p>
      Security incidents, events, and weaknesses in the data processing system need to be reported at the earliest possible stage 
      to enable assessment by the Data Protection Officer (DPO) and the Head of the Security Incident Response Team (SIRT). The DPO 
      supports the SIRT in identifying when a series of events or weaknesses have escalated to an incident. The SIRT needs detailed information from data subjects or personnel to determine whether an incident is occurring.
    </p>

    <p>Examples of Security Events, weaknesses, and common forms of Security Incidents have been provided below:</p>
